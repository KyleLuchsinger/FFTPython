# FFTPython
An interactive tool for visualizing and exploring Fourier transforms in real-time. This application allows users to manipulate multiple frequency components with different waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth) and immediately see how changes affect both time and frequency domains. Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
